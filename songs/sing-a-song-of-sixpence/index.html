        <p>Sing a song of sixpence,<br>
A pocket full of rye.<br>
Four and twenty blackbirds,<br>
Baked in a pie.</p>
<p>When the pie was opened,<br>
The birds began to sing;<br>
Wasn&rsquo;t that a dainty dish,<br>
To set before the king?</p>
<p>The king was in his counting house,<br>
Counting out his money;<br>
The queen was in the parlor,<br>
Eating bread and honey.</p>
<p>The maid was in the garden,<br>
Hanging out the clothes,<br>
When down came a blackbird<br>
And pecked off her nose.</p>
