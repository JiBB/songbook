        <p>London Bridge is falling down,<br>
Falling down, falling down.<br>
London Bridge is falling down,<br>
My fair lady.</p>
<p>Build it up with wood and clay,<br>
Wood and clay, wood and clay,<br>
Build it up with wood and clay,<br>
My fair lady.</p>
<p>Wood and clay will wash away,<br>
Wash away, wash away,<br>
Wood and clay will wash away,<br>
My fair lady.</p>
<p>Build it up with bricks and mortar,<br>
Bricks and mortar, bricks and mortar,<br>
Build it up with bricks and mortar,<br>
My fair lady.</p>
<p>Bricks and mortar will not stay,<br>
Will not stay, will not stay,<br>
Bricks and mortar will not stay,<br>
My fair lady.</p>
<p>Build it up with iron and steel,<br>
Iron and steel, iron and steel,<br>
Build it up with iron and steel,<br>
My fair lady.</p>
<p>Iron and steel will bend and bow,<br>
Bend and bow, bend and bow,<br>
Iron and steel will bend and bow,<br>
My fair lady.</p>
<p>Build it up with silver and gold,<br>
Silver and gold, silver and gold,<br>
Build it up with silver and gold,<br>
My fair lady.</p>
<p>Silver and gold will be stolen away,<br>
Stolen away, stolen away,<br>
Silver and gold will be stolen away,<br>
My fair lady.</p>
<p>Set a man to watch all night,<br>
Watch all night, watch all night,<br>
Set a man to watch all night,<br>
My fair lady.</p>
<p>Suppose the man should fall asleep,<br>
Fall asleep, fall asleep,<br>
Suppose the man should fall asleep?<br>
My fair lady.</p>
<p>Give him a pipe to smoke all night,<br>
Smoke all night, smoke all night,<br>
Give him a pipe to smoke all night,<br>
My fair lady.</p>
