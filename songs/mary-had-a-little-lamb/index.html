        <p>Mary had a little lamb,<br>
His fleece was white as snow,<br>
And everywhere that Mary went,<br>
The lamb was sure to go.</p>
<p>He followed her to school one day,<br>
Which was against the rule,<br>
It made the children laugh and play<br>
To see a lamb at school.</p>
<p>And so the teacher turned it out,<br>
But still it lingered near,<br>
And waited patiently about,<br>
Till Mary did appear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why does the lamb love Mary so?&rdquo;<br>
The eager children cry.<br>
&ldquo;Why, Mary loves the lamb, you know,&rdquo;<br>
The teacher did reply.</p>
