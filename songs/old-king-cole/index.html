        <p>Old King Cole was a merry old soul<br>
And a merry old soul was he;<br>
He called for his pipe, and he called for his bowl<br>
And he called for his fiddlers three.<br>
Every fiddler he had a fiddle,<br>
And a very fine fiddle had he;<br>
Oh there&rsquo;s none so rare, as can compare<br>
With King Cole and his fiddlers three.</p>
