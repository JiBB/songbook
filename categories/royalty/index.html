        <p>As I was going by Charing Cross,<br>
I saw a black man upon a black horse;<br>
They told me it was King Charles the First—<br>
Oh dear, my heart was ready to burst!</p>

        <p>Old King Cole was a merry old soul<br>
And a merry old soul was he;<br>
He called for his pipe, and he called for his bowl<br>
And he called for his fiddlers three.<br>
Every fiddler he had a fiddle,<br>
And a very fine fiddle had he;<br>
Oh there&rsquo;s none so rare, as can compare<br>
With King Cole and his fiddlers three.</p>

        <p>Sing a song of sixpence,<br>
A pocket full of rye.<br>
Four and twenty blackbirds,<br>
Baked in a pie.</p>
<p>When the pie was opened,<br>
The birds began to sing;<br>
Wasn&rsquo;t that a dainty dish,<br>
To set before the king?</p>
<p>The king was in his counting house,<br>
Counting out his money;<br>
The queen was in the parlor,<br>
Eating bread and honey.</p>
<p>The maid was in the garden,<br>
Hanging out the clothes,<br>
When down came a blackbird<br>
And pecked off her nose.</p>
