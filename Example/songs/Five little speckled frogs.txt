Title: Five little speckled frogs
Tags: counting, wild animal

Five little speckled frogs
Sat on a speckled log
Eating the most delicious bugs

Yum yum

One jumped into the pool
Where it was nice and cool
Then there were four green speckled frogs.

_(Repeat with one fewer frog each time, ending with:)_
â€¦Then there were no green speckled frogs.
