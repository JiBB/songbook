Title: Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush
Tags: game, verse

**Chorus**

Here we go round the mulberry bush,
The mulberry bush,
The mulberry bush.
Here we go round the mulberry bush
So early in the morning.

This is the way we _[perform an action]_,
_[Perform an action]_,
_[Perform an action]_.
This is the way we _[perform an action]_
So early in the morning.
